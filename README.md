# EEG-Classification

EEG-Classification is a machine learning project focused on analyzing and classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The repository provides a series of Jupyter Notebooks for feature extraction, signal preprocessing, model training, and result visualization. The project aids research in neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and clinical diagnostics through advanced classification methods for EEG data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shashi9170/EEG-Classification.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    - You will need Python, Jupyter Notebook, and relevant ML/DL libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, tensorflow/pytorch, numpy, matplotlib, etc.).
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in sequence.
4. Place your EEG data in the `eeg_dataset` directory if using your own dataset.
